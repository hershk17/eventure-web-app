# Sprint 1 Planning

## User Stories to be tackled this Sprint

- As an app user, I want to search events, attractions, and locations using keywords so that I can find activities that interest me.<br>

## User Story Acceptance Criteria

### Feature completion: 
- The user has options to search for events or locations, with options to filter / sort results.
- When the user makes a search query, the server returns the corresponding list of events & attractions or locations. 
- The front-end formats the response data and displays the resuls appropriately. 

### Definition of done:
