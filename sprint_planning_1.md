# Sprint 1 Planning

## User stories to be tackled this sprint.

As an app user, I want to search events and attractions using keywords so that I can find activities that interest me.
<br>

## Acceptance criteria for a user story to be considered completed. 

### Feature completion: 
- The server returns correct data needed to display on the front-end.
- The front-end displays the returned data correctly 
- When the user enters his search keyword in the search box, the server returns a list of events and attractions (could be name, location, postal code) containing the keyword. 
- The front-end displays the searched data. 

### Definition of done: 
- The test cases pass on all intended platforms (Android and iOS).
vCompleted feature is merged into the main branch.
