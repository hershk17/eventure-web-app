# Definition of Done

## Code

- In order for code to be considered “done”, it must be merged into the master branch.
- The merged code must be in a working state with no major bugs.  
- Completed features must be tested and reviewed before being merged to the main branch.
- At least two group members must approve a pull request prior to a merge.

## Application

- The application is well documented. Each function should have a short description of what it does.
- The application sufficiently covers the respective user story.
- The application will have passed all test cases (automated and manual) and generates the expected output. Corner cases should be included in the test cases.
- The test cases must pass on all intended platforms (Android and iOS). 

## Deployment 

- Beta builds will be deployed and available to beta testers once all group members are unable to find any bugs.
- Production builds will be deployed to the play store once all major and most minor bugs are fixed.

## Documents

- All required documents are completed and submitted on time.
- All required documents are fixed according to the professor's feedback.
- A presentation or a video is made to demo and guide users on how to use the app.
