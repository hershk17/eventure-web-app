# Project Description

In this project, a safe social media platform to find companions for activities, events, and other points of interests, based on the users’ locations and interests is developed. The language we use is React Native, which allows the mobile application to run natively on Android and iOS devices. Target users include travellers, people interested in group activities, and want to make new friends. 

Some of the most important features are described as follows:

## Finding Events and Points of Interest

The user will be able to search for a location, for example: “Toronto”, to find attractions to visit as well as events nearby. Information such as location name, formatted address, open hours, pictures, and Google reviews. The user can then find companions to travel with and attend events together. Users will be able to search by tags and event descriptions.

Another way to search for events will be by using a map that contains different points of interests (parks, restaurants, landmarks, concerts are a few examples).  

## Creating Events 

A user can create an event by entering a form including (title, location, event description and a few more data fields) which self-checks for errors. 
A user can also choose a location first and then fill out the form containing other data fields 

## User-Entity Interaction

Once a user finds an event that he or she would like to join, a direct message can be exchanged with participants to finalize plans. Users can review locations, events, and other users by rating and text feedback.  

Users will have a news feed that will show their friend’s recent activity.  This would include friends attending an event, reviewing a location, or uploading images.

## Location Searching

The application displays consisting of name, opening hours, photos, Google rating, reviews, type, geometry, etc. The API also offers Place Autocomplete and Query Autocomplete.

### These features require the app to have an authentication and authorization system in place (different roles such as event coordinator or user; each with varying accessibility).
