# Working Agreement

## Communication

- We are committed to meeting through Discord every Tuesday and occasionally on weekends.
- Team members are expected to come on time for the group meetings.
- When a message is sent into the group, all group members are expected to reply within 10 hours. If there is a hard deadline in the following 48 hours, group members are expected to respond within 5 hours.
- These meetings will aim to discuss our outline for the week, plan for future objectives, brainstorm ideas, and compile our research for the upcoming assignment.
- An agenda outlining various tasks to be completed is to be created weekly.
- A soft deadline will be set 3 days prior to the actual deadline to accommodate for a final review period.

## Programming practices

- All items/features must be completed and merged 24 hours prior to the weekly deadline, followed by a 24 hour testing period.
- All code will be merged through our shared GitHub repository.
- Merges should be short and frequent.
- Each team member should make sure that their code compiles and is in a working state before pushing their code to the shared branch.
- Each member is equipped with the knowledge of pushing and pulling code processes.

## Working Ethics

- Team members will be respectful of one another. This means that team members will listen to each other and carry out debates in a civilized manner.

## Steps To Be Taken Against Misconduct

- Step 1: A group discussion regarding the memberâ€™s behavior will be held.
- Step 2: If step 1 is insufficient, we will discuss the matter in a group meeting and a formal warning will be issued. We will then revisit our expectations and goals as a group to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
- Step 3: If step 2 is insufficient, we will consult our professor regarding the misconduct to consider the appropriate mode of action.
