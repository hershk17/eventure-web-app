GitHub Workflow

Clone the Github repo to our local directory.
Create a development branch with a proper name for the current sprint.
Pull before making any changes.
Create a major feature/issue branch with a proper name.
Write and test the code before committing changes.
If the code has bugs and requires another member to look at, create and push to a separate branch.
Stage and commit the changes with a meaningful message.
Push the changes to the feature branch.
Once testing has passed, create a pull request from feature branch to development branch.
Review the pull request and resolve any conflicts, then merge with the development branch.
After development for the current sprint is completed, create a pull request from the development branch to the main branch.
Review the pull request and resolve any conflicts, then merge with the main branch.
Delete the Feature branch after a successful merge into the main branch.
