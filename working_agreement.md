# Working Agreement

## Communication

- We are committed to meeting at least once a week through Discord. 
- Our usual meeting time is Saturday or Sunday at 9pm. If additional meetings are necessary, we may meet during the week to complete the assigned work. 
- These meetings will aim to discuss our outline for the week, plan for future objectives, brainstorm ideas, and compile our research for the upcoming assignment.
- Team members are expected to come on time for the group meetings.

## Programming practices

- All code will be merged through our shared GitHub.  Each member is equipped with the pushing, pulling code process. 
- Each team member should make sure that their code compiles and is in a working state before pushing their code to the shared branch.

## Working Ethics

- Team members will be respectful of one another. This means that team members will listen to each other and carry out debates in a civilized manner.
- Work will be divided equally amongst team members.
- Team members will support one another.  If there are any issues, he or she will reach out to the other members so that the team is aware of any ongoing issues. The team will then make necessary accommodations.
- All members will communicate clearly and effectively.  

## Work Quality Expectation

- All work shall be completed on time. The team will ensure that all user stories will be completed and the mobile application is published.
- Work will be reviewed and tested consistently to check for bugs and edge cases.

## Steps To Be Taken Against Misconduct

- Step 1: A group discussion regarding the memberâ€™s behavior will be held.
- Step 2: If step 1 is insufficient, we will discuss the matter in a group meeting and a formal warning will be issued.  We will then revisit our expectations and goals as a group to ensure that everyone is on the same page. 
- Step 3: If step 2 is insufficient, we will consult our professor regarding the misconduct to consider the appropriate mode of action.
